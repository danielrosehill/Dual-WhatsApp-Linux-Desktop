Please generate for me a Whatsapp client that will run on the Linux desktop. I use Open Susie Tumbleweed with KDE Plasma. It should certainly work on this distro, but ideally on others too. 

I use two Whatsapp accounts throughout the day: WhatsApp (regular) and WhatsApp Business. 

I'd like to have a simple desktop utility that allows me to toggle between my two accounts. I'd like to be able to configure the personal Whatsapp account and the business Whatsapp account separately. 

I'd like to have a side by side tabbed layout. And clear indicators for personal and business on either tab. In the settings I'd like to be able to configure each account. 

I would like to be able to minimize the entire application to the system tray. And to be able to independently toggle notifications for the business and personal channels.
